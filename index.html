        <h1>Cosmos Ventures</h1>

        <h3>Prototypes for the philosophy of technology</h2>

        <i>Cosmos Ventures funds provocative new prototypes, essays, and creative projects that explore fundamental questions around the philosophy of technology.</i>

        <h3>Mission</h3>

        <p>
        We support entrepreneurs and thinkers pursuing ambitious lines of inquiry into how technological progress can enhance or inhibit human freedom, excellence, and dignity. We carve a new path beyond dystopian existential risk calculations and accelerationist transhumanism - nurturing a philosophical framework for technology that affirms human agency.

        Cosmos Ventures is an experimental arm of the Cosmos Institute, which is dedicated to cultivating an enterprising optimism around technology via philosophical inquiry.
        </p>

        <h3>Apply</h3>

        <p>
        We are interested in exploring the implications of AI and machine learning for areas such as economic planning, scientific discovery, human agency, and the role of philosophy in the technology industry.

        Projects should take an interdisciplinary, humanistic approach, drawing from philosophy, political theory, economics, computer science, natural science, and other fields. We fund both new endeavors and existing efforts, though we expect a major deliverable within three months.

        All backgrounds are welcome, either individually or as a team. Cosmos works with academics and entrepreneurs across the humanities, technology, and sciences.
